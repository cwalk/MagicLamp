**Differences:** This is an original circuit I based mine off of. In my final prototype, I am utilizing a 16 count LED ring, and an Arduino Trinket Pro (5V/16MHz). The ring, Arduino, and battery share a common ground, but I soldered the battery 5V onto the Arduino "bat" pin and the led ring 5V onto the arduino "5V" pin. The data in for the ring I soldered to pin 3 on the Arduino.
